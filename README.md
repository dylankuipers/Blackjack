# Blackjack
My take on blackjack with OOP.
I made this for an exercise on Jarvis at Bit Academy.

How to play the game:

1. Clone the repository onto your own computer
2. Open the index.php file and execute it in the terminal.
3. Enjoy :)

If you would like to use custom names you can easily change these in the index.php file.
